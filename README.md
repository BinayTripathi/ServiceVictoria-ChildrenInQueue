### Summary

The overall objective of the applications :
```
>	The application provides the solution to **Children in Queue elimination problem** 
> As per the problem, for a given count of children (say n) and a skip sequence(k) every kth child is removed from 
  the circular queue and we need the sequence of elimination and the winner
>	The application consists of a non-executable depedency jar project(ChildrenInCircleAlgo) which contains the algorithm . The
>	algorithm has a time complexity  of order O(nk) and space complexity of O(1) - ignoring a list that is used to collect the final outout
```
